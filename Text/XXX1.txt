Ibelieve it's stupid for a teenager to identify himself
with a particular political party. I realised that a month
ago when I had a talk with a schoolmate who wanted
10 identify me as either a democrat or a communist —
a friend or an enemy. I said T was neither but he got
annoyed. We couldn’t understand each other.

Tl be 18 soon and then I'll have to vote for a
political party. But T don't feel I'm prepared to make
such a choice. I think I'll need some time to explore
and keep an open mind because 1 really want to be
free. I'd like to be a spectator of it all rather than
playing on one team or another. I want to see the
whole arena and then find out for myself which team
is better for me.
